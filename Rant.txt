So sometimes i wonder if the people i talk to really even care what i have to say to them and if they really care,

Cause sometimes i get a thought in my head that some of them really don't even like me, It's kind of weird
Knowing someone i might hang around with Hate's me, i know the shit i say is bad but like if you really didn't wanna talk
they can just not talk to me,

Cause i know I'm a dick i know I'm rude, i know the shit i say affects people, but if we wanna dig really deep into why this
is my personality, 


[Family Problem's]


We can start at the age of 6 life right where i started to gain the ability to think for my own, of course it wasn't at 6
A little before but we can say 6 for the story right now

So my father was really a dick, the care package of fucked up dad, Something you would see in a movie type of shit,
He would always say he was there for me after abuse shit, Trauma built from there on out, Can't get into the whole whole story,
But it was a hard time for me, The time's I've spent with him make's me consider suicide, The stuff he does to this day makes me
Wanna die, i consider suicide every night cause the shit he has done has ruined my life completely, Everything was stressful
As you would expect he would scare me for this shit, Everyday till the age of 11 where it was the time where it was most on my
Mind, It were times where i thought Grabbing his gun and shooting myself was highest, it was stressful
Most the time i thought pulling the trigger was a viable option to use to leave this world


[Personal life]


The stuff i do in my life or how i am is something i reflect on and try to fix but it's like i conflict hate for no reason,
Its like i have someone telling me i don't wanna see people happy


[The Man on my shoulder]


He tells me a lot of the stuff people do isn't the right thing, even at this moment of me writing this i'm considering suicide
Just fuck up the peoples day to see me on the floor. just as if i just want someone to struggle with me
Just as if he want's me to find ways to commit suicide, There is always gonna be way's that someone would want me dead
The only person that was there for me was my mother, and to sit there watching her struggle was... let's say hurt
It made me want to Kill a lot of people in my circle in this instance my dad..
He was the whole reason i wanted to grow up at the time just so i could watch him just die in the mercy of my hands
Just watching him on the floor beg for mercy of Ur hand's with his life fading away,


[A lot of lies]


My mother and father went through a lot of lie's and it hurt's, My mother is the one who help's me carry out my dreams and life
When i consider suicide it was her i was thinking about, but at times she was considering the same thing,
And i always wondered if it was the last moments i had with her at time's,
The hate i would put upon my father would of ended it, she lie's. i lie, my dad lie's, we all lie to each other
Now it makes me really think, if i lived alone by myself, who would've been there for my mom, she couldn't even call for her
Kid for help if i was gone, but i lied to myself if i was dead no one would care, but really she would be most affected cause
Her daughter and my older brother was her main concern, If i died the lie's i would carry for her and the amount of hate would
Have me in hell, i hate that piece of shit he was the reason i wanted to start killing in the first place, He kick started it.
But besides him, the people who would try to bully me when i was a kid was another part of it.
Those are the times i wish i listened to my little man on my shoulder, he wanted me to kill the fucker's.
It was a time where people would make me genuinely wanna go over and plan their downfall and the moment's where their family
Would see them dead in the casket as if they were the one who ruled over other's and got a hand dealt for it,


[Recovery]


When i was 13 i was considering Fixing my life it was a time where i tried to fix it all but it was a struggle,
I reached far in then the struggle i was going through with the family was still a burden on my shoulder it was like
Everything wanted to collapse on me make me fall back to the time of suicide, the moments that would be my last,
But the only thing saving me and keeping me from doing that was seeing my mother happy, i always tried for her,
But i was still going of the hate around me so i acted as if i didn't see her through her struggle,
I wish if i could go back that i could help her out more,
Help her through her hard times, i wish i could have been born as a angel and help her through her time's but,
This life isn't a fairytale so i never could,
I wish that everything i did had option when it came to my mom, i would love to do the best for her,
Give her the son she always wanted, the life she always wanted cause at this point it's like she wasn't living,
The life she had wasn't used to the fullest, so if there was a way even right now,
To help her, i would, i would do anything for my mom, she was the reason I've lived for the time now


[PART TWO BABY]


So through out all of this i've went out to find way's to have fun, i had a friend called jonathan, mexican kid,
Shorter then me at the time by a long shot this is were my downfall came
Of my life came, it was when i met him the life i had was gonna change by a decent amount, So jonathan he was a bad kid
He went out stole shit We always hanged out but in the end we went to steal my parents car and steal we fucking did, we went out for a good 2 hours with it
We went back to the house but the cops were there, we got caught, my bad, i got caught, i had taken the blame, i snitched cause i got information he did so
And you know what kind of person i am, i couldn't have him win, I wasn't going to take it on the shoulder
